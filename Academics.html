    <p class="p1"> I am currently a Junior at <a href="https://www.reed.edu/about-reed/" target=_blank>Reed College</a> in sunny Portland, Oregon. I will be graduating with a degree in <em>Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics</em>(May 2025). I graduated with an <em>Advanced Regents Diploma, Distinction in Math and Science</em> from All City Leadership Secondary School(June 2021) in Bushwick, Brooklyn. <br><br><br> 
      Shortly after being accepted into the <a target=_blank href="https://www.seo-usa.org/scholars/">SEO Scholars</a> program(Fall 2017), I was selected to receive an educational stipend, out of 500+ other scholars in my cohort, which enabled me to learn the basics of web design through a paid summer coding boot camp. <img class="imgR" src="JulianExplain.jpeg"><br><br><br> <img class="imgRMOBILE" src="JulianExplain.jpeg">My mother and I never had a working computer at home, so not only was this my first introduction to the world of computer science, but it also spurred within me an immediate interest in technology. For the first time in my life, I truly felt that the websites, programs, and systems I would continue to use every day since, could one day be created by me, <strong>for people like me</strong>. I continued my early education in CS and coding, by joining <a target=_blank href="https://codenation.org/about/">CodeNation</a>(previously known as ScriptEd) at the start of high school. I loved learning how to code for the entirely new type of challenge it presented—it was tricky, frustrating, and at times, seemingly unattainable. Yet, I always returned to the screen. The joy of overcoming an obstacle, but most importantly, the pleasure of growing to face more challenging ones, is what drives me to seek rigor in whatever I do. <br><br><br>  After graduating, I spent two years studying Computer Science at Reed College, taking Algorithms & Data Structures and Computer Systems, in addition to Reed's introductory CS and math courses(CS 1, CS 2, and Discrete Structures). I then transitioned to Mathematics, with a focus in Statistics, because my academic and research interests primarily lie in formulizing otherwise human, behavioral, and seemingly unpredictable processes using statistical methods—such as developing an algorithm that determines a prospective student's best choice school, a current project of mine.

      Simply though, math excites me. It's a discipline that uniquely contains all the types of challenges I yearn for and more. It's puzzly and fulfilling in a way that just makes me want to smile, and share this world with those who may lack the institutional resources to access this joy otherwise(see <a href="Community.html">Community</a>). I have taken courses in Linear Algebra, Calculus, Statistics, and Probability so far, and am enthusiastic to be taking Mathematical Statsitcs, Data Science, and Vector Calculus this spring(2024). Here are two recent projects I have completed: <a target="_blank" href="https://rpubs.com/julianiz123/1118882">a study</a> of post-undergrad outcomes by traditional measures of academic success, which I lead in a group(Fall 2023), and <a target="_blank" href="https://figshare.com/articles/preprint/Multicollinearity/24922116">a paper</a> on multicollinearity from a probability standpoint(Fall 2023).<br><br><br>
      
      
       Arriving at Reed with a deep interest in computer science, I have since expanded my understanding of the world humans and modern technology occupy, by taking classes that have challenged me to investigate the intersections between tech, politics, art, and language. Most notably, I have been involved with Reed College's comparative politics department since Fall 2022, both as a student and teaching assistant, primarily focused on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQWGYw5E1utUXSMAhcKP__aDG7wF9x_6y4Yl7e840YmS4PJ64SDO6LDXP_IG44kk-JM9k5WvdjTyCWn/pub">how emerging technologies could influence poltical movements and systems in Latin America</a>.  <br><br><br>
      I have also been writing poetry since the 2nd grade, and have done so consistently since my sophomore year of high school, under the mentoring of Michael Homolka, who I met and am grateful for meeting, in the Wednesday critical reading SEO weekday class at Urban Assembly in downtown Brooklyn. Here is my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAF2UH-sYUo/o_RhgKHygRgkjhbGrQP16A/view?utm_content=DAF2UH-sYUo&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor">latest collection of poetry</a>. Besides writing poetry, I love playing squash, cooking, watching movies, and playing chess during my free time.<br><br><br>
